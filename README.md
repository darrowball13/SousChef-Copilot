## SousChef-Copilot

As the power of AI and Machine Learning models has increased, it has opened the opportunity for these technologies to help assist people in everyday life. Often given the name "copilots", they take prompts and deliver solutions that borrow from a large array of information that is either inaccessible, hard to find, or hard to parse through for the user. Depending on the copilot being used, the types of user prompts can vary to include text, images, or audio files, which can be used in tandom to provide more refined answers to the questions asked. With regards to image prompts, there are many models that can identify a wide variety of objects present in a single image, despite how cluttered the image may be. Therefore, the SousChef copilot was envisioned as a form of copilot that could be used by any person to discover new recipes and food ideas based on ingredients they may either have in their homes, or items they see out in the world. By encorporating together the capabilities of these varies third party APIs, a person should be able to find a vareity of recipes with only a picture.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The overall vision of this project is to create an AI copilot that can give users the opportunity to expand their food horizons and discover a variety of different recipes for all meals from different cultures. 
Ideally, the copilot would be able to use a picture taken by the user deliver to them a recipe only using the ingredients in the picture. If there are too few ingredients in the picture to make a full recipe, SousChef should be able to either provide substitutes for missing ingredients. Additionally, if the user provides any specifications (ex. hot/cold, specific culture, etc.), the recipe output should be curtailed to those specifications. 

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

The SousChef Copilot will offer an integrated and streamlined solution for a variety of user that want to be able to make the most of the food they have at home, or food they may be looking for in stores. Some examples of users may include, but are not limited to:

1. **Busy People**

- For many people, after spending a full day at work, they come home tired and without the motivation to prepare any food, for both themselves and any potential partners. By offering them an easy-to-use copilot that can produce recipes from simply taking a picture of the ingredients available, this may inspire them to create something, rather than spending money to order takeout.

2. **Students on a Budget**

- Due to the costs of education in many states, students are often looking for ways to save money on all everyday expenses. Based on this, the SousChef copilot can provide these students with a smarter way to shop for food by helping them identify recipes that can be made from less expensive super market options.

3. **People with Food Allergies**

- For people with allergies to common foods or ingredients, it can be hard to try new things due to the the prevalence of their allergent. By using this copilot, these people can expand the range of recipes that are available to them by only using ingredients they know are safe for them, or they can prompt the copilot for substitutions that can be made for the ingredients that they cannot have.

3. **Parents with Picky Eaters**

- Some kids are picky eaters, which can make it diffiult for the parents to think of meals to give them that both meet their nutritional needs and satisfy their pickiness. SousChef would give these parents the opportunity to help identify new recipes that use only the foods they know their kid will eat.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The vision for this copilot is for it to be able to identify recipes based on user-given images, and be able to curtail those recipes based on further instructions given either before or after the image is submitted. Therefore, features of the copilot will include:

- Ability to accept multiple forms of user prompts: text and image
- API that can identify multiples objects present in an image and feed those as inputs to a recipe finder prompt
- Can provide substitutions for ingredients, upon user request or if the ingredients aren't found in the given image
- Can curtail recipes to the users request (hot vs. cold, cultural, etc.)
