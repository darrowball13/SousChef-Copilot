## SousChef-Copilot

As the power of AI and Machine Learning models has increased, it has opened the opportunity for these technologies to help assist people in everyday life. Often given the name "copilots", they take prompts and deliver solutions that borrow from a large array of information that is either inaccessible, hard to find, or hard to parse through for the user. Depending on the copilot being used, the variety of the types of user prompts can be wide, whether it is text, an image, or audio file. With regards to image prompts, there are many models that can identify a wide variety of objects present in a single image, despite how cluttered the image may be.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The overall vision of this project is to create an AI copilot that can give users the opportunity to expand their food horizons and discover a variety of different recipes for all meals from different cultures. 
Ideally, the copilot would be able to use a picture taken by the user deliver to them a recipe only using the ingredients in the picture. If there are too few ingredients in the picture to make a full recipe, SousChef should be able to either provide substitutes for missing ingredients. Additionally, if the user provides any specifications (ex. hot/cold, specific culture, etc.), the recipe output should be curtailed to those specifications. 

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

The SousChef Copilot will offer an integrated and streamlined solution for a variety of user that want to be able to make the most of the food they have at home, or food they may be looking for in stores. Some examples of users may include, but are not limited to:

1. **Busy People**

- For many people, after spending a full day at work, they come home tired and without the motivation to prepare any food, for both themselves and any potential partners. By offering them an easy-to-use copilot that can produce recipes from simply taking a picture of the ingredients available, this may inspire them to create something, rather than spending money to order takeout.

2. **Students on a Budget**

- Due to the costs of education in many states, students are often looking for ways to save money on all everyday expenses. Based on this, the SousChef copilot can provide these students with a smarter way to shop for food by helping them identify recipes that can be made from less expensive super market options.

3. **People with Food Allergies**

- For people with allergies to common foods or ingredients, it can be hard to try new things due to the the prevalence of their allergent. By using this copilot, these people can expand the range of recipes that are available to them by only using ingredients they know are safe for them, or they can prompt the copilot for substitutions that can be made for the ingredients that they cannot have.

3. **Parents with Picky Eaters**

- Some kids are picky eaters, which can make it diffiult for the parents to think of meals to give them that both meet their nutritional needs and satisfy their pickiness. SousChef would give these parents the opportunity to help identify new recipes that use only the foods they know their kid will eat.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

 

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.
